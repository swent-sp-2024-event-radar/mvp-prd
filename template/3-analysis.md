# Analysis of the Situation

## Competitive Landscape

The market for Event Radar is highly competitive, with several established players offering robust event management and discovery solutions. Key competitors include:

- EventBrite: A leading global platform known for its comprehensive event creation and ticketing services.
- Resident Advisor: Focuses on electronic music events and nightlife, appealing to a niche but passionate audience.
- Infomaniak, EventFrog, and Smeetz: Dominate the event ticketing market in Switzerland, providing tailored solutions for various event types, from concerts to conferences.

These competitors have established user bases and advanced features, presenting significant competition for Event Radar. However, none seem focused on facilitating the connection during events and providing an ecosystem to create communities. We therefore believe that Event Radar has significant potential in disrupting its market.

## Complementary Products

Complementary products in the market enhance the event discovery and attendance experience, aligning well with Event Radar’s objectives. These include:

- Meetup: Facilitates social gatherings based on shared interests, driving community engagement similar to Event Radar’s goals.
- TicketSwap: Provides a secure platform for reselling tickets to those who can no longer attend an event, addressing secondary market needs.
- Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter): Crucial for event promotion, allowing organizers to reach broader audiences and engage with potential attendees.

Integrating these complementary products could enhance Event Radar's functionality, providing users with a seamless experience from event discovery to post-event connections.
