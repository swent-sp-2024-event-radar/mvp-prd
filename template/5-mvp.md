# The MVP

The Event Radar MVP aims to bring together the essential features needed for event discovery, networking, and management to meet the value proposition in the aforementioned document   High user engagement and satisfaction will serve as key metrics to attract event attendees and hosts as primary users. Below, we identify the target and key personas and list the set of features that we believe are essential in generating repeated traffic.

## Personas and Scenarios

**Event Radar has two target and key personas:**

- **Event Attendees**: Young to middle aged users who are interested in discovering and attending events in their area, ranging from social gatherings to professional networking events.
- **Event Hosts/Organizers**: Young to middle aged users who organise events, seeking tools to streamline event registration, ticketing, and attendee engagement, as well as promote their event to a young adult audience.

Both personas go hand in hand and the app cannot exist without one or the other, thus they are both the key personas. 

**To show how these personas would use Event Radar these are the high-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product:**

- **Adopting the Product**: A university student hears about Event Radar and it's unique blend of social interaction and event discovery. Intrigued by the idea of easily discovering and attending events and making new friends all in one centralized app, they download the app to explore upcoming activities relevant to their academic and personal interests.
- **Using the Product**: The student uses Event Radar to find and register to social gatherings and workshops on campus to meet like-minded people and have a good time. They also discover off-campus events like local music shows and cultural festivals using the app's location-based event discovery feature.
- **Sharing the Product**: After a successful experience using the app by discovering new events and keeping in touch with other attendees, the student shares their enthusiasm with friends and classmates. They post about the app on social media platforms, recommending it as a valuable tool for staying connected and discovering exciting events both on and off campus. They even host some of their own events on the platform, making even more people aware of it.

## User Stories and Key Features

**User Stories for Event Attendees**

- As an event attendee, I want to view a list of nearby events, so that I can decide which event to go to next to socialize and meet new people.

**We aim to integrate the following key features into Event Radar, in order of priority:**

- **Browse/Discover Events (Event Attendee):** Users can easily find events happening near them.
- **Join/Register for an Event (Event Attendee):** Users can register for events seamlessly through the app.
- **Create/Edit an Event (Event Host):** Event hosts can create and manage event details.
- **Generate QR Code (All Users):** Unique QR codes for each user to facilitate easy networking.
- **Scan QR Code to Add a Friend (Event Attendee):** Users can scan each other's QR codes to connect.
- **Scan QR Code to Verify Event Attendee Status (Event Host):** Event hosts can scan QR codes to verify attendees at the event.
- **View/Message Friends (Event Attendee):** Users can see a list of friends made via QR code scans and send messages within the app.
- **Group Chat (All Users):** Event attendees can see others going to the event and receive information from event hosts about the event through the group chat.
- **Private Mode Settings (Event Attendee):** Event attendees can customize what information is displayed to others, allowing for enhanced privacy and control over personal data shared around events.
- **Multi-Payment Option Checkout (Event Attendee):** Event attendees can choose from multiple third-party payment options to pay for event tickets. This feature provides flexibility and convenience, allowing users to select their preferred payment method.
- **Bank Transfer Payment Gateway Setup (Event Host):** Event hosts can set up a bank transfer payment method to receive payments from attendees. This feature ensures smooth and efficient processing of transactions, enhancing the overall payment experience for both hosts and attendees.

We believe these are the key features to Event Radar to make the MVP and ensure our app is a marketable product differentiable from current apps on the market. **Browse/Discover Events** and **Join/Register** for an Event are the entry points to the app, allowing event goers to discover events and engage further, making them the highest priority features. **Create/Edit an Event** and **Scan QR Code** to Verify Event Goer Status are essential for event hosts to manage events effectively. Event browsing (the first two features) would not be possible without event hosting or management. **Generate QR Code**, **Scan QR Code** to Add a Friend, **View/Message Friends**, **Group Chat**, are features that differentiate our app by enhancing networking and communication between event goers and hosts, allowing us to deliver high value to our users. **Private Mode Setting** is an essential feature in our app for event attendees to have privacy and control over their personal data shared around events. Finally, **Multi-Payment Option Checkout** and **Bank Transfer Payment Gateway Setup** will broaden the event host user base, helping create more interesting events and hence retain event attendees as users. 


## Success Criteria

**User Adoption and Engagement**

- Aim to onboard at least 5% of the target population within the first month of launch, measured by number of downloads.
- Achieve a DAU (Daily Active Users) of 10% and MAU (Monthly Active Users) of 70% in the first month.
- Achieve a retention rate of at least 40% in the first month.
- User adoption success relies on both event attendees and event hosts interacting with the app (you cannot have one without the other). Thus:
    - Track event attendee interactions via metrics such as the frequency of event registrations, number of QR code scans to add friends, measuring the friend connections made, and the number and frequency of messages after the event. 
    - Track event host interactions via metrics such as number of events created, ticket sales, and number of QR code scans to check-in tickets, measuring the event attendance. 

**Feedback and Satisfaction**

- Achieve a minimum average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars on app stores within the first three months of launch.
- Conduct monthly surveys in the first year of launch to gather user feedback, aiming for at least 60% positive feedback regarding app usefulness and user experience. This is both event attendee reviews and ratings as well as post-event surveys to understand attendee experiences and event host satisfaction. 
- Implement at least half of the user-requested features or improvements by two weeks after each feedback survey. This will help build user trust in our platform, increasing user adoption and retention.

**Commitment from Event Organizers**

- Engage with event organizers and hosts to discuss terms and gather feedback on the app's utility and performance.
- Secure agreements or commitments from at least 10 event organizers to use Event Radar for their events within the first quarter post-launch.

By focusing on these key features and success metrics, Event Radar aims to deliver a valuable and engaging experience for both event goers and event hosts, setting the foundation for future growth and feature expansion.

## Features Outside the Scope

**Advanced Social Networking Features**

- **Social feeds for user interactions:** Social feeds refer to a stream of content that users can consume in order to enhance the discovery of new events tailored to the userâ€™s interests. However, implementing social feeds requires complex recommendation algorithms and additional infrastructure for content discovery. To keep the MVP simple and focused on core functionalities, social feeds will not be included.
- **Photo Upload for Events**: Allowing photo uploads from event attendees tied to the event they attended necessitates additional database storage and management for additional media files, increasing the complexity of the app. This feature does not provide significant value for the MVP and can be considered for future iterations.
- **In-App CarPool/ Commuting Coordination:** Enabling users to offer or request rides or to notify how they will be commuting to the event fosters pre-event socialising among attendees from similar areas. This feature enhances the community aspect of the app. However, its implementation demands intricate backend programming and extensive integration with mapping services like Google Maps.

**Complex Event and Ticketing Management Tools and More**

- **Advanced ticketing options:** Features such as reserved seating for sit-down events and discount codes introduce additional layers of ticket management and require complex booking systems. As these are not central to the core purpose of the app, they will be excluded from the MVP.
- **Comprehensive event analytics:** Providing detailed reports and beneficial statistics on event data involves creating extensive data collection and analysis tools. While beneficial for event hosts, this functionality is not critical for the appâ€™s initial launch and primary objectives.
- **Ticket Reselling:** While enabling event attendees to resell purchased tickets can greatly enhance the user experience and mitigate risks associated with ticket buying, it introduces complexity, such as ensuring secure transactions and verifying the authenticity of resold tickets but will be included in later versions of the app.

**Extensive Partner Integrations**

- **Integration with external calendar apps (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar):** This feature is not essential for the initial marketable version of the app and adds unnecessary complexity. Synchronizing data with external calendar services requires robust data management and synchronization mechanisms, which can complicate the development process and delay the launch.

**Integration Plan for Future Features**

In the post-MVP phase, the integration of out-of-scope features into Event Radar will be guided by an iterative approach, shaped by user feedback and market demands. Comprehensive event analytics will take precedence as the initial focus. This is essential because our ability to retain event attendees hinges on attracting top-tier event organizers. Achieving this requires our app to match and surpass the performance of other event platforms. Ticket reselling is the next priority, as it will help build confidence and trust in the app.

Following analytics integration, the rollout of advanced social networking features will address the core value proposition of Event Radar, enhancing user engagement and event discovery. The appâ€™s development of a solid user base, user feedback and market trends will inspire choices for long term integrations with event venues or organizers to further enrich the user experience and retain the solid user base. Advanced ticketing options will then be introduced, such as reserved seating and discount codes, aligning our event management tools with industry standards. Lastly, integration with external calendar apps, though a lower priority, will be considered based on ongoing user feedback and its potential to enhance user convenience. 

Throughout this process, continuous gathering of user insights will drive feature planning and development cycles, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and new features are integrated seamlessly into the app sequence.
