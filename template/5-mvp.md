# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

*Who are the target personas for this product?*
- **Event Attendees**: Students and young professionals who are interested in discovering and attending events in their area, ranging from social gatherings to professional networking events.
- **Event Hosts/Organizers**: Students, young professionals, or organizations responsible for planning and managing events, seeking tools to streamline event registration, ticketing, and attendee engagement, as well as promot their event to a young adult audience.

*Which is the key persona?*
- **University Student**: A university student who is actively involved in campus life and interested in exploring social and academic events both on and off campus. This persona values opportunities for networking, discovering new interests, and engaging in community activities.

*High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.*
- **Adopting the Product**: A university student hears about Event Radar through a campus event promotion or fellow classmates. Intrigued by the idea of easily discovering and attending events and connecting with other event goers all in one centralized app, they download the app to explore upcoming activities relevant to their academic and personal interests.
- **Using the Product**: The student uses Event Radar to find and register for campus lectures, workshops, and social gatherings. They also discover off-campus events like local music shows and cultural festivals using the app's location-based event discovery feature.
- **Sharing the Product**: After a successful experience attending a campus event found through Event Radar, the student shares their enthusiasm with friends and classmates. They post about the app on social media platforms, recommending it as a valuable tool for staying connected and discovering exciting events both on and off campus. They even host some of their own events on the platform, making even more people aware of it.

## User Stories and Key Features

*User stories about how various personas will use the product in context.*
- As an event goer, I want to view a list of nearby events, so that I can decide which event to go to next to socialise and meet new people.
- As an event goer, I want to have a unique identification ticket that allows me access to events I register for, so that I can easily access events and participate seamlessly.
- As an event goer, I want to scan the QR codes of people I meet so that I can keep track of who I met and catch up with them later.
- As an event goer, I want to view a list of people whose QR codes I have scanned at events, so that I can easily recall who I met.
- As an event goer, I want to be able to initiate private messages with people whose QR codes I scanned in an event, so that I can connect with them without exchanging contact information manually and communicate with them outside of the event context.
- As an event organizer I want to be able to create events on the app so that people can register and stay informed about the planning.

*Identify and prioritise the key features required.*  
In order of priority:
1. browse/discover events (event goer)
2. join/register for an event (event goer)
3. create/edit an event (event host)
4. generate QR code
5. scan QR code to add a friend (event goer)
6. scan QR code to verify event goer status (event host)
7. view/message friends (event goer)

*Justify the importance of each feature.*
- the first 2 key features have to do with Epic 1: allowing event goers to discover events. this is important because this is the entry point to the app, and how we will engage users further
- feature 3 and 6 are important for Epic 3 which focuses on the event host
- features 4, 5, and 7 are associated with Epic 2, which is the main differentiator of our app: being able to better communicate with friends and fellow event goers 

## Success Criteria

*How will you evaluate the success of the MVP?*

*Metrics include user penetration, quality / satisfaction.*

*If applicable, progress in discussions with ecosystem partners / investors / customers.*

**User Engagement Metrics:**
- Measure user adoption rate: Number of downloads and active users.
- Track user interactions: Frequency of event registrations, QR code scans, and friend connections made through the app.
- Analyze user feedback: Gather user reviews and ratings to assess satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

**Event Performance Metrics:**
- Monitor event hosting activities: Number of events created and managed using Event Radar.
- Evaluate ticketing and attendance: Track ticket sales, check-ins, and attendee feedback for hosted events.
- Assess event success: Gather post-event surveys to understand attendee experiences and event organizer satisfaction.

## Features Outside the Scope

*The MVP must be viable and minimal.*

*Which features don’t belong in it.*

**Advanced Social Networking Features:**
- Social feeds or timelines for user interactions.

- Gradually introduce additional features in subsequent iterations or updates of the app post-MVP launch.

**User Feedback and Iterative Development:**
- Gather user feedback through app usage and surveys to identify feature priorities and pain points.
- Incorporate user insights into feature planning and development cycles to align with user needs and expectations.

**Manage Development Resources Efficiently:**
- Allocate development resources strategically to balance MVP refinement and feature expansion.
- Evaluate technical feasibility and resource requirements for integrating new features into the app sequence.
