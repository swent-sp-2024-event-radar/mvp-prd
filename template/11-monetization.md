# Business Model

## Expected Operating Costs

Our steadily growing community of users and hosts will incur certain operational costs. Initially, these are expected to be:

- **Marketing and Promotion:** Investment in customer acquisition strategies and channels such as social media, search engine marketing, and partnerships.
- **Server and Infrastructure:** Costs based on expected user load and data storage needs.
- **3rd Party Services:** Payment processing fees, email services, and analytics tools.
- **Salaries:** For team members, including developers, designers, and head of marketing.

## Revenue Streams

While our initial focus is on building a community rather than monetising, we plan to introduce several revenue streams once we have established a healthy user base:

- **Commission Fees:** A percentage of the ticket price for each purchase made through Event Radar.
- **Paid Advertisement:** Boosting the visibility of events in the app to attract more traffic.
- **Premium Subscription:** A subscription-based model for hosts to access premium features such as event boosting, fee-less ticket transactions, prioritised technical support, etc.
- **Sponsorships:** Opportunities for sponsors who would like to promote their products or services to our community, particularly those related to events and music.
