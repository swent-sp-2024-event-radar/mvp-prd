# Business Model


Expected operating Costs
We are expected to have a steady growing community of users and hosts, at first our main operational costs are expected to be:
- Marketing and promotion costs to attract users and hosts - investing in customer acquisition strategies and channels such as social media, search engine marketing, and partnerships are key operational costs in the initial phase.
- Server and infrastructure costs based on expected user load and data storage needs
- 3rd party services costs such as payment processing fees, email services, and analytics tools
- Salaries for the team members, including developers, designers, and head of marketing

Revenue Streams
The business model can take many shapes and forms as the business grows, at first we intend to focus on building a community rather than monetising. Once we have reached a healthy user base, Event Radar will be able to monetise as follows:
- Commission fees on ticket purchases (a percentage of the ticket price).
- Paid Advertisement, boost the visibility of events in the app to attract more traffic
- Premium Subscription based model for hosts to access premium features such as event boosting, fee-less ticket transactions, prioritised technical support, etc.
- Potential Sponsors who would like to promote their products or services to our community (event and music related businesses)
