The V1 PoC of Event Radar, as planned by Sprint 10, includes essential features that demonstrate the app's core functionalities (see more in the MVP section). At sign-up, users receive a unique QR code that acts as their event entry ticket and allows them to share their profile with others. Users can then browse and sign up for upcoming events, connect with other users by scanning their QR code, and engage via in-app private messaging. They will have the option to personalise their experience by customising their profiles, enabling them to connect more effectively with others and build a strong community. Additionally, event hosts can create, edit and promote their events, as well as scan tickets to verify entry permissions.
