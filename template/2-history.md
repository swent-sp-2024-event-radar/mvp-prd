# History

The V1 PoC of Event Radar, as planned by Sprint 10, includes essential features that demonstrate the app's core functionalities (see more in the MVP section). 

## User Features

At sign-up, users receive a unique QR code that acts as their event entry ticket and allows them to share their profile with others. Users can then:

- Browse and sign up for upcoming events
- Connect with other users by scanning their QR code
- Engage via in-app private messaging

They will have the option to personalise their experience by customising their profiles, enabling them to connect more effectively with others and build a strong community. 

## Event Host Features

Additionally, event hosts can:

- Create, edit and promote their events
- Scan tickets to verify entry permissions
