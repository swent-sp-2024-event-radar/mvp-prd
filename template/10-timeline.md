# Timeline/Resource Planning

Execution Roadmap

The MVP development is planned to be executed over a 14-week time period.This includes setup, development, testing, rollout, and feature iteration to ensure a successful product launch.
This 14 week period breaks down into 4 Milestones, each of 3 to 4 weeks. The first 3 milestones contain all of the appâ€™s core functionalities.
These milestones will help us assess our progress as a team of 7 people, comprising 1 Figma UI/UX Developers, 2 Front-end Developers, 2 Backend Developers, and 2 Software Testers.

## Milestone 1
Allow users to authenticate and browse for events

| Sprint | Objectives | Outcomes |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Team Environment Setup | Set up the team environment on GitHub, finalise all user stories. |
| 2 | Design and Planning | Create wireframes and mockups for the app, develop app architecture diagram, app blueprint. |
| 3 | Core Feature Development | Implement sign-up flow, set up user database, develop login functionality, create home page, release initial APK for testing. |

## Milestone 2
Allow users to search for events, register for them, allow hosts to create events, and generate QR codes

Add co-organisers to have privileges on manging event.  Implement Scan Ticket functionality. |
| 10 & 11 | Internal Testing and Optimisation | Conduct thorough testing across devices, optimise UI/UX, fix bugs, and refine features based on feedback. |
| 12 | Pre-Launch Preparation | Final bug fixes and optimisations, prepare app store and launch materials. |
| 13 | Alpha Testing | Roll out app to alpha testers, gather user feedback, and implement necessary hotfixes. |
| 14 | Beta Testing and Full Rollout | Initiate beta testing, address feedback, finalise the launch strategy, and roll out the app to a wider audience. |

## Development Resources
The primary cost of development for the product comes from the developer team. The team will include:
