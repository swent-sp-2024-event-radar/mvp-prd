# User Analytics and Acceptance

To understand how our users interact with our app, we need to establish a comprehensive analytics pipeline that collects relevant data. This will enable us to identify bugs and areas for improvement, ensuring we provide the best possible user experience. Here are some key metrics and strategies:

### Key Metrics

We will measure the usage of various features by tracking the following metrics:

-    Chats: Number of active users engaging in chats, frequency, and session length, as well frequency and number of message per friend.
-    Browsing: User interactions with event browsing, including session duration and frequency.
-    Hosting: Number of events created and hosted by users.
-    QR Code Scans: Number of new friendships made through QR code scanning.
-    Subscription/Attendance Rate: Percentage of users subscribing to and attending events.

We also want to measure the total number of active users on the app.

### Success Criteria

-  Aim to onboard at least 5% of the target population within the first month of launch, measured by number of downloads.
-  Achieve a DAU (Daily Active Users) of 10% and MAU (Monthly Active Users) of 70% in the first month.
-  Achieve a retention rate of at least 40% in the first month.
-  Achieve a minimum average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars on app stores within the first three months of launch.
-  Maintaining a minimum monthly user retention rate of 60% over the first year of app launch

### Analysis plan

To enhance user experience and ease of navigation, we will analyze user behavior based on the collected data:

1. Browsing Time: Measure the time users spend browsing events to determine if they can quickly find events they want to register for and if the browsing experience is engaging.
2. Popular Events Analysis: Identify popular events by analyzing the number of events created, attended, and the types of events most frequently attended.
3. By observing user activity in chats with their friends, we can determine, based on the quantity and frequency of interactions, which friendships are long-lasting and which are not. We can then analyze the types of events where these long-lasting friendships were formed.

These data will help refine our advertising strategies. All data will be anonymized to comply with privacy standards, maintaining user trust and adherence to regulations.

### A/B Testing Ideas

1. Implement A/B testing to optimize user engagement by testing different layouts for the event discovery screen. This will help us determine which designs best enhance user interaction and satisfaction.
2. Implement A/B testing to optimize the way host interacts with the application and ease as much as possible this complex process.
